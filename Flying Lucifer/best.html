              <h5 class="card-title">Best Cruiser - Ducati Diavel 1260 S</h5>
              <p class="card-text">It's long and low with a menacing demeanor, is powered by a massive V-twin engine, and it's Italian. Wait. What? That's
                right, the Best Cruiser of 2019 is straight outta Bologna. Revamped for 2019, the Diavel 1260 S gets a 1,262cc Testastretta DVT engine that
                cranks out 139 hp and 85 pound-feet of torque on the Cycle World dyno, but thanks to its DVT variable valve timing, that power is just as
                usable cruising down Main Street as it is sucking the doors off the local doctor's Corvette.</p>

              <h5>Best Adventure Bike - KTM 790 Adventure R</h5>
              <p>While chasing KTM's Adventure badass Chris Birch across the Moroccan desert—at a speed that was more appropriate for dirt bikes—we quickly
                realized the 2019 KTM 790 Adventure R is the new high mark of the adventure segment. The long-travel WP suspension eats terrain that would
                damage other bikes, a low-slung fuel tank provides light and flickable character, a snappy 799cc parallel twin is surprisingly controllable,
                and svelte and compact ergonomics enhance rather than hamper aggressive riding.</p>

              <h5>Best Enduro/Dual Sport - KTM 500 EXC-F</h5>
              <p>KTM's "ready to race" slogan flows through all its motorcycles, and the 2019 500 EXC-F lives up to that as much as a dual sport can in the
                face of toughening emission and noise rules. In reality, you could ride the 500 EXC-F to a GNCC, remove the mirrors and license plate, compete,
                and ride home—at least, if you lived within range of its 2.5-gallon fuel tank.</p>

              <h5>Best Motocross Bike - Kawasaki KX450</h5>
              <p>Motocross is about building the most focused tool for speed, period. Sometimes it might be an amazing engine that stands out—or plush suspension
                or razor-sharp turning ability—and the rest of the bike just comes along for the ride. This year is about balance. The new-for-2019 Kawasaki KX450
                (no more "F") takes the prize as Best Motocrosser for this very reason.</p>
            </div>

              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best5.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Lightweight Streetbike - Kawasaki Z400</h5>
              <p>"Dynamic headroom" is an audio term that explains how an amplifier can punch above its weight when asked to. Think when hushed movie dialog is
                followed by massive explosions or something similar. We borrow the term here for the Kawasaki Z400 because few under-500cc motorcycles have ever
                been so easy to approach for a newer rider while also absolutely ripping when asked to, up to and including shredding a racetrack. This high-level
                competence makes everyday riding at any speed confidence-inspiring. Need to grind out a 60-mile-a-day commute? No problem, and it'll throw in
                phenomenal fuel mileage.</p>

              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best6.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Middleweight Streetbike - Triumph Street Triple R</h5>
              <p>Three consecutive wins is a nicely coincidental achievement for one of the greatest inline-triple powerplants ever devised. Sometimes we think the
                765cc three-cylinder engine's siren sound would be enough on its own to put it on top of the middleweight class. And maybe it would. But the Triumph
                Street Triple R (and its lower-cost S and higher-spec RS siblings) bring so much more to the table than just great sound.</p>

              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best7.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Open-Class Streetbike - KTM 1290 Super Duke GT</h5>
              <p>Sport-touring motorcycles are often an understated, button-down, tragically not-so-hip affair. Think ­Maroon 5 piped directly into your Schuberth
                helmet. The 2019 KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is not that. It's more like diving deep into the circle pit of a Black Flag show. It's rowdy. It's fast.
                It's aggressive. But just like a now-middle-aged punk, it has grown up and can act accordingly when necessary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best8.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Standard Motorcycle - Triumph Scrambler 1200 XE</h5>
              <p>Triumph's Scrambler 1200 XE looks the part of a street scrambler with its dual megaphone high pipes emanating from a Bonneville 1200 engine. The
                classically styled fuel tank, long bench seat, and wire-spoke wheels are a throwback to the '60s. But look deeper, and you'll find a pair of
                long-travel, dual-­spring Öhlins shocks, and a Showa fork with suspension travel eclipsing that of the most hard-core adventure motorcycles.
                Electronic wizardry such as lean-sensitive traction control, ride modes, turn-by-turn navigation via Google, and the ability to control a GoPro
                camera from the bars makes you wonder exactly which segment it belongs in.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best9.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Touring Motorcycle - BMW R 1250 GS Adventure</h5>
              <p>We are firm believers that just about any motorcycle can make a decent touring rig. Editor-at-Large Peter Egan recounts the Honda CB160 he didn't
                think twice about riding through Canada, for example. But some motorcycles do make the job of covering a lot of ground in comfort and confidence
                easier than others. This year, we were shocked to find how much the BMW R 1250 GS Adventure had changed with the new ShiftCam flat twin and its
                newfound power. But it is also way more luggable and precise when pounding rocks at crawling speed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item">
              <img class="d-block w-100" src="img/best10.jpg" alt="">
              <h5>Best Superbike - Ducati V4 R</h5>
              <p>Ducati has claimed a lion's share of Cycle World Ten Best Superbike accolades since 2008. The MotoGP-derived V4 Desmosedici RR streetbike offered
                an early prelude to the current Panigale V4 platform. Five years ago, the carbon-fiber-frame 1199 Superleggera V-twin captured lightning in a bottle,
                redefining class performance, albeit at a hefty cost per pound saved. While the odds of owning such exotics would be likened to having a big-game cat
                caged in your garage, last year's Panigale V4 S Best Superbike selection spoke more—or at least hollered distantly—to mainstream sport enthusiasts.
                The homologation-special Panigale V4 R has upped the ante with engine and chassis performance upgrades wholly focused on World Superbike competition.</p>
